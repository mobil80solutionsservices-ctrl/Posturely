# Extension Icons

Place the following icon files in this directory:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels  
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

You can create these from your main app icon or use a simple posture-related icon.

For testing, you can temporarily remove the icons section from manifest.json.
